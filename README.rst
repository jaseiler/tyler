Features
--------

This is a proof of concept; please pardon the mess.

* `home`: this handles the landing page, faq, and similar concerns that don't call for separate apps.
* `members`: this handles member profiles. It's very spare for now.
* `news`: this handles short twitteresque announcements and news. I'll probably dump this app. I just exists to demonstrate quickly something akin to newsfeed on the main page.
* `supportingmaterials`: this handles pages for article companion sites with code and data. It's spare for now. I wanted a generic name so I picked supportingmaterials. what a meh name?


* TODO
