Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `tyler` for local development.

1. Fork the `tyler` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/tyler.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv.::

    $ cd tyler/
    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

  Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
tests::

    $ flake8 companionpages
    $ companionpages/manage.py test

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests
2. Check https://travis-ci.org/runmycode/tyler/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass
3. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.

Contributing Code
-----------------

Before you get started, remember that it is easier for us to accept pull
requests that are narrow in scope and easy to review. Ideally we want to see
pull requests with a comment that is a logical changeset so plan to work in
this fashion.

When committing a change, please include the issue number in your commit comment.
This helps us track the progress in the related issue. This works like so
  
  $ git commit CONTRIBUTING.rst -m 'improved the contributing docs for #1'

TODO: define some guidelines for what makes something easy to review.
