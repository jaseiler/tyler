The\r\n    actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the\r\n    complete set of instructions which generated the figures.</i><i class=\"icon-quote-right\"></i></p>\r\n\r\n    <cite>D. Donoho</cite>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n \r\n<p>With <font color=\"green\"><b>ResearchCompendia</b></font> we provide the tools to publish this \"actual scholarship\" by hosting data, code, and methods in a form that is accessible, trackable, and persistent.\r\n\r\nIt has been a long held principle of academic science that all respectable\r\nresearch must be <b>reproducible.</b>  As such, authors of published research have\r\nhistorically been expected to <b>archive</b> and <b>share</b> the data used to obtain to\r\ntheir conclusions.  Now that much of that data and analysis is generated\r\ncomputationally, it is natural to expect that code and parameters also be\r\nshared.  Additionally, it is right to expect that researchers ought to <b>document</b>\r\nthe computational portions of their research methods as thoroughly as they\r\nwould document a tabletop experiment.<p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><i class=\"icon-quote-left\">We introduce the concept of a compendium as both\r\na container for the different elements that make up the document and its\r\ncomputations (i.e. text, code, data,...), and as a means for distributing,\r\nmanaging and updating the collection.\u201d</i><i class=\"icon-quote-right\"></i></p>\r\n\r\n<cite>Gentleman, R. and Temple Lang, D. <a href=\"http://biostats.bepress.com/bioconductor/paper2\">\r\n\"Statistical Analyses and Reproducible Research\"</a> (May 2004).

We will provide tools to share and\r\narchive the data, codes, documentation, parameters, and environmental settings\r\nlinked with published research all in one place.  Soon, we wish to support the\r\n<b>verification</b> and <b>validation</b> processes by providing for the remote <b>execution</b> of shared codes in our cloud resources, and the <b>visualization</b> of results.  Most of all we wish to make these tools heavily automated, and easy to access and utilize to lessen the exertion\r\nrequired from already overburdened academic researchers in the process of\r\npublishing fully reproducible work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why create a Research Compendium?</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Boost your citation rates and recognition, and get credit for your code in addition to your publications.</li>\r\n<li>Defend your research.</li>\r\n<li>Archive your research and track your computational procedures.</li>\r\n<li>Speed up the process of converting scientific results into productive forces.</li>\r\n<li>Allow others to build on your work in a highly visible and trackable way.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><font color=\"green\"><b>ResearchCompendia</b></font> follows these main objectives:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To provide the tools for researcher to easily communicate all the information necessary to make all publications fully reproducible.</li>\r\n<li>To allow researchers to quickly disseminate the methods of their research. This will considerably increase the potential of citations of scientific papers.</li>\r\n<li>To provide the scientific community with the ability to use the latest scientific computational methods.</li>\r\n<li>To allow members of the academic community to quickly and easily  verify and validate scientific results and to demonstrate their robustness.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To do this we hope to provide the following tools:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Quick and elegant Compendia Page creation with easy to navigate access to all relevant data, code, documentation, and results, with no coding required by the researcher.

Researchers and institutions know full well the strain they are under to publish quickly and concisely, and are therefore pressured to share the minimum required of them in terms of data code and documentation. We wish to ease the burden on researchers while promoting a culture of well documented, sustainable and reproducible research, by making it easy and quick for them to publish, track, archive and link all relevant digital data and methods in one place.</p><p id=\"fellows\">\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are very interested in partnering with any institutions and organizations that make complementary efforts or have similar missions. We are eager to partner with groups and projects in all relevant realms, whether that be policy, promotion, technical tools for researchers, archival resources, research workflow improvement and tracking tools, or any other project, service or mission you might think also promotes this cause.</p>\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in working with us or just wish to discuss plans and ideas, please <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"funders\">Fellows</h2>\r\n\r\nAny individuals who believe they have skills, connections, or resources relevant to the mission of ResearchCompendia for the promotion of open and reproducible research.  Please <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us</a>.  We have an active fellows program and we would be eager to have you join our team. We can offer unique research experiences, and experience in the promotion and development of an advanced web app. We will only ask for whatever time and resource commitment you are comfortable with.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Funders</h2>\r\n\r\nWe are attempting to offer a valuable service to the world of academic research.  The mission of reproducibility is not only directly beneficial to the careers of researchers, and to the advancement of science, but it is also incredibly important for the reconstruction of trust in the scientific and academic world.  As retraction rates increase and more and more subfields are rocked by scandals or irreproducible research, support for the sciences in society also drops. We wish to show verifiably the rigor, impartiality, and integrity that we know most published research displays. To do this, we need to be able to provide the tools offered by <b>ResearchCompendia</b> reliably and stably. </p>\r\n\r\nFor <b>ResearchCompendia</b> to sustainably host, archive, and track an increasingly large number of contributions, as well as support a growing active user base for our cloud resources, we need sustainable funding for data and code hosting, computational resources, promotional resources, and human resources. If you or your organization is interested in supporting our mission please <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us</a>. <p></p>  <span id=\"journals\"></span>\r\n\r\n<b>ResearchCompendia</b> operates not for profit, and any contributions will be made to our non-profit organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Journals</h2>\r\n\r\n<b>ResearchCompendia</b> hosts code and data associated with articles published in scientific journals.\r\nJournal editors are welcome to invite  and encourage the authors who publish in their journals to upload their code and data to ResearchCompendia. This invitation can be mentioned on the journal website and in the revision and acceptance letters. A example is provided below: </p>\r\n\r\n\"The JOURNAL OF XXX would like to invite you to enrich and defend your article by uploading relevant computer code, data, and supplementary materials on the ResearchCompendia online repository. Your article will be then linked to a dedicated and easily citable ResearchCompendia website. To create a compendium, please go to: <a href=\"/0/create/\" >http://www.researchcompendia.org</a>\"</p>\r\n\r\nThe service is completely free. Please <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us</a> if you need more information.\r\n\r\nIt is in the interest of all scientific publications that the research they promote be fully verifiable and reproducible. The sharing of data and code has not only been shown to increase a journal's impact factor, by increasing citation rates, but also increases the trust in that journal because data sharing policies reduce the number of retractions published.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"institutions\">Institutions</h2>\r\n\r\nIt is partly the responsibility of employing institutions to encourage a culture of responsible and reproducible research. It is important for the reputations of both the researchers and their host institutions. If you are a part of an institution that wishes to promote such values, we implore you to encourage your researchers to share their data, code and methods for all publications. Toward that goal, we would hope that you would list <b>ResearchCompendia</b> among the many other useful tools for researchers on any institutional documents or websites discussing such policies and practices.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to promote for, collaborate with, or to support <b>ResearchCompendia</b> in any other ways, please <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"researchers\">Researchers</h2>\r\n\r\nResearchCompendia is intended both as a tool to improve the communication of science, and to make the lives of publishing scientists easier. There are many reasons to create a compendium with our site:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Boost your citation rates and recognition, and get credit for your code in addition to your publications.</li>\r\n<li> Defend your research.</li>\r\n<li>Archive your research and track your computational procedures, with our free provided data, documentation, and code hosting and tracking.</li>\r\n<li>Speed up the process of converting scientific results into productive forces.</li>\r\n<li>Allow others to build on your work in a highly visible and trackable way.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPlease <a href=\"/0/create/\"> create a compendium</a> here if you wish to share data and code from your publications in a convenient and easily citable way. Please <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us</a> if you have any questions, comments, or feature requests.<p></p>\r\n\r\nIf you wish to verify, reproduce, or build on previous research, please <a href=\"/0/\"> browse</a> our existing compendia and see if we have anything of interest.  We will be adding remote execution and commenting functionality shortly.",

If you are a web or software developer interested in our mission to promote reproducible and open science, please <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us </a> or visit <a href=\"https://github.com/researchcompendia/tyler\"> our github page</a> to see how you can contribute.  We keep an active list of tasks and issues, and we are always happy to take on more feature additions such as further supported packages and languages for remote execution in our cloud.<p></p>\r\n\r\n<b>ResearchCompendia</b> is a project to allow scientists to create compendium as introduced by Gentleman and Temple Lang as a digital scholarly object comprising all relevant narrative, code, and data required to present and disseminate published research as truly reproducible science. Now that much of that data and analysis is generated computationally, it is natural to expect that code and parameters also be shared. Additionally, it is right to expect that researchers ought to document the computational portions of their research methods as thoroughly as they would document a tabletop experiment.\r\n\r\nThe application has the following goals.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We will make it possible to archive all of the data, codes, documentation, parameters, and environmental settings linked with published research in a versioned form.\r\n<li>We will support the verification and validation processes by providing for the execution of shared code and the visualization of results.\r\n<li>We want to help and encourage researchers to manage their research in a way that makes it mixable and executable.\r\n<li>Most of all we wish to make these tools heavily automated, and easy to access and utilize to lessen the exertion required from already overburdened academic researchers in the process of publishing fully reproducible work.\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you are a programmer, you may find yourself thinking that some of these goals remind you of a continuous integration and build system. And yes, in some sense the goal with this prototype is to create a continuous integrations system for computational research. <p></p>\r\n\r\nProject milestones are loosely organized on <a href=\"https://github.com/researchcompendia/tyler/wiki/planning-scratchpads\">our planning wiki page</a>.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Project Structure</h3>\r\n\r\nThis is a django project with the following structure.<p></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>home: this handles the landing page, faq, and similar concerns that don't call for separate apps.\r\n<li>users: this handles users and profiles by using django-allauth and cookiecutter-django's user template\r\n<li>compendia: this handles the archiving and representation of a compendium.\r\n<li>lib: this holds code that does not call for an app\r\n<li>api: this handles our service apis.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n\r\nFree software: <a href=\"http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\">MIT License</a></br>\r\nTechnical Documentation: <a href=\"http://tyler.rtfd.org/\">http://tyler.rtfd.org</a></br>\r\nIssue tracker: <a href=\"https://github.com/researchcompendia/tyler/issues\">https://github.com/researchcompendia/tyler/issues</a></br>\r\nIssue kanban: <a href=\"https://huboard.com/researchcompendia/tyler\">https://huboard.com/researchcompendia/tyler</a></br>\r\nWiki: <a href=\"https://github.com/researchcompendia/tyler/wiki\">https://github.com/researchcompendia/tyler/wiki</a></br>\r\nIRC: #hackingscience on freenode.net</br>\r\n\r\n<h3>Development Environments</h3>\r\n\r\nBeta <a href=\"http://researchcompendia.org/\">http://researchcompendia.org</a></br>\r\nPre-prod: <a href=\"http://preprod-researchcompendia.herokuapp.com/\">http://preprod-researchcompendia.herokuapp.com</a>\r\n",
