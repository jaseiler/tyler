It has been a long held principle of academic science that all respectable research must be reproducible. Now that much of that data and analysis is generated computationally, it is natural to expect that code and parameters also be shared. \r\n\r\nWith __ResearchCompendia__ we wish to address these issues facing reproducibility in computational research. We will provide tools to share and archive the data, codes, documentation, parameters, and environmental settings linked with published research all in one place. Soon, we wish to support the verification and validation processes by providing for the remote execution of shared codes in our cloud resources, and the visualization of results. Most of all we wish to make these tools heavily automated, and easy to access and utilize to lessen the exertion required from already overburdened academic researchers in the process of publishing fully reproducible work.\r\n\r\nThe __ResearchCompendia__ website is operated not for profit.
